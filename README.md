# Daan Demaecker
Hi, my name is Daan Demaecker and I am a game developer, in this github page, I will tell you a bit more about who I am, what I do, what I did and what I want to do.  

## Studies
I am currently finishing my second year of Game Development at DAE in Belgium.  

## About me
I have always loved games and a couple years ago I fell in love with everything behind them, from the first line of code to the final particle of polishing.
