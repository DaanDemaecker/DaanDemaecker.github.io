Hi, my name is [Daan Demaecker](AboutMe.md) and I am a game developer, in this github page, I will tell you a bit more about who I am, what I do, what I did and what I want to do.  

# Projects
## School projects
### [Warp Warfare](https://luckyelias.itch.io/group29-warp-warfare)
A group project where I was the **sole programmer**, I had a lot of *fun* during this project with my colleagues.  
The names of my colleagues can be found on our Itch.io, linked above.
We were tasked to create a ***fun***, local multiplayer game in either Unity or Unreal Engine.  
We chose Unity as we only had one programmer and I was a llot more comfortable and familiar with Unity, compared to Unreal Engine.  
Our game ended up as a free for all battle with portal guns as your only weapon, I am proud
of what my team and I accomplished together.

### [D2D Engine - Bomberman](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/D2DEngine)
For my Programming 4 class, we had to create a 2D engine from a bare bones starting point and were each given a game to recreate as proof that our engine worked.  
The game given to me was bomberman. I had a ton of fun creating this and am proud of the result.

### [Cuphead remake](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/CupheadRemake)
In my Programming 2 class, our skills we learned in the first semester were put to the test.  
We had to choose a 2D platformer game and recreate it as best as possible using a minor framework.  
I chose Cuphead as game because I have always loved the style and wanted a challenge.  
The result speaks for itself.

### [Software Raytracer](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/RayTracer)
For my Graphics Programming 1 class, we made a CPU raytracer from scratch. 
The performance will never be great as it runs purely on CPU, but it helped us understand core concepts of graphics programming and raytracing.

### [Dual Rasterizer](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/DualRasterizer)
For my Graphics Programming 1 class, we also made a rasterizer that switches from DirectX to a self made CPU rasterize.  
One of them is obviously more performant (try to guess which one), but it also taught us a lot more about the process of rasterizing.

## Private projects

### [Vulkan Renderer](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/VulkanRenderer)
After graphics programming 1, I was very interested in Rendering APIs, so I looked for more and found Vulkan.  
My curiosity for Vulkan can never be quenched and I try to work for it every day.

### [D3D-Lite-Engine](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/D3D-Lite-Engine)
A small 3D, component-based engine using my VulkanRenderer, with object loader as example project made for school.
