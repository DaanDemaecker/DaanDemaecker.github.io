<h2> Intro </h2>
<p>
I have always loved games and a couple of years ago I fell in love with everything behind them, from the first line of code to the final particle of polishing. <br/> 
Because the industry is relatively new, I never even dreamed of making my own games until I discoverered
<a href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/" target="_blank">Digital Arts and Entertainment</a>, but when I did, I was hooked.  <br/> 
In the last year, my love and interest for Graphics Programming has also been growing steadily and I am more and more certain that's the path I want to pursue. <br/>
</p>

<h2> Soft skills </h2>
<p>
I love solving problems (as can be seen by my ever-growing Rubik's cube collection) and programming has won my heart as well.   <br/>
I am good at taking and applying feedback, a lot of this site looked different before receiving and applying feedback from my friends and colleagues. <br/>
</p>

<h2> Studies </h2>
<p>
I started studying Latin in high school, but after a year, i changed tracks to pursue math and science.   <br/>
I studied math and science for the next 5 years, this is where I found my first passion for learning.   <br/>
After highschool, I started studying physics at the school KULAK in Kortrijk, Belgium.   <br/>
After a year I discovered making games was an option and my mind was blown, it had math, it had some applied physics, it was perfect. <br/>  
This is how I got to study Game Development at <a href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be" target="_blank">Digital Arts and Entertainment</a> in Kortrijk, Belgium where I am now in my third year. <br/>
