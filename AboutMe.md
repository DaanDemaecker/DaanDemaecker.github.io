## Intro
I have always loved games and a couple years ago I fell in love with everything behind them, from the first line of code to the final particle of polishing.  
Because the industry is relatively new, I never even dreamed of making my own games until I discovered DAE, but when I did, I was hooked.  
I love solving problems (as can be seen by my ever growing Rubik's cube collection) and programming has won my heart as well.  

## Studies
In highschool I started with studying Latin, but after a year I realised mindlessly memorizing wasn't for me.  
This made me change tracks and I studied math and science for the next 5 years, this is where I found my first passion for learning.  
Because I thought I found my passion in science, mainly physics, I started studying physics at the school KULAK in Kortrijk, Belgium.  
But after a year I once again changed tracks because the physics were mostly theory and not much practice, this made me lose interest.  
After looking for an alternative I realized making games was an option, it had math, it had some applied physics, it was perfect.  
This is how I got to study Game Development at [**DAE**](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be) in Kortrijk, Belgium where i am now finishing my third year.
