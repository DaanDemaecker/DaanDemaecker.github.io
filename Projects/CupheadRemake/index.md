## Description
In my Programming 2 class, the skills we learned in the first semester were put to the test.  
We had to choose a 2D platformer game and recreate it as best as possible using a framework that contained little more than an update loop and a renderer.  

I chose Cuphead as my game because I have always loved it and recently bought it. This posed a challenge, of course, Cuphead wasn't as simple as other games out there like the good-fashioned Mario and others, but I was ready for a challenge and the result speaks for itself.

## Software
Visual studio C++
