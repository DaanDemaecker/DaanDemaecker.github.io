<h2> Description </h2>
<p>
During my Game Development course at <a href="https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be" target="_blank"> Digital Arts and Entertainment </a> in Belgium, we made our own basic 2D engine in our Programming 4 class.
This inspired me to make my own basic 3D engine. <br/>
In my Graphics Programming class, we learned about DirectX and made our own <a href="https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/DualRasterizer" target="_blank">software rasterizer</a>, this made me look more into graphics programming and graphics API's.
After some research, I decided to use the <a href="https://www.vulkan.org" target="_blank">Vulkan</a> API to render. <br/>
As I was new to Vulkan I started by creating a separate <a href="https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/VulkanRenderer.git" target="_blank">renderer</a> that turned into a testing project, which can also be found on my GitHub.
