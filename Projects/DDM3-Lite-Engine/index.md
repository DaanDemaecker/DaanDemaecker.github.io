## Description
During my Game Development course at [Digital Arts and Entertainment](https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be) in Belgium, we made our own basic 2D engine in our Programming 4 class.
This inspired me to make my own basic 3D engine.
In my Graphics Programming class, we learned about DirectX and made our own [software rasterizer](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/DualRasterizer), this made me look more into graphics programming and graphics API's.
After some research, I decided to use the [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org) API to render.
As I was new to Vulkan I started by creating a separate [renderer](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/VulkanRenderer.git) that turned into a testing project, which can also be found on my GitHub.

## Software
Visual studio C++  
Vulkan
