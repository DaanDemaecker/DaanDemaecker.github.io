<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
For my Game Mechanics class during my second year of Game Development, we were given 2 keywords and the task of creating a game in Unity based on those 2 keywords. <br/>
The keywords I received were <b>Turn-Based</b> and <b>BossFight</b> and my gears started turning.<br/>
I created a game where the player fights 3 bosses simultaneously with 3 weapons that each only damage their assigned boss.  <br/>
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>
<p>
- Unity
