## Intro
For my Game Mechanics class during my second year of Game Development, we were given 2 keywords and the task of creating a game in Unity based on those 2 keywords.  
The keywords I received were ***Turn-Based*** and ***BossFight*** and my gears started turning.
I created a game where the player fights 3 bosses simultaneously with 3 weapons that each only damage their assigned boss.
