## Intro
In a group project where I was the sole programmer, I had a lot of fun during the project with my colleagues.  
The names of my colleagues can be found on our Itch.io, linked above.
We were tasked to create a fun, local multiplayer game in an engine of our choice.  
We chose Unity as we only had one programmer and I was more accustomed to Unity than Unreal engine.
Our game ended up as a free-for-all battle with portal guns as your only weapon, I am proud
of what my team and I accomplished together.
