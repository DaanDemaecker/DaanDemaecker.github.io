A group project where I was the sole programmer, I had a lot of fun during this project with my coleagues.  
The names of my colleagues can be found on our Itch.io, linked above.
We were tasked to create a fun, local multiplayer game in an engine of our choice.  
We chose unity as we only had one programmer and unreal can get complicated.  
Our game ended up as a free for all battle with portal guns as your only weapon, i am proud
of what my team and I accomplished together.
