blue background = directX | gray background = CPU

## Description
For my Graphics Programming 1 class, we made a rasterizer that switches from DirectX to a self-made CPU rasterizer.  
One of them is obviously more performant (try to guess which one), but it also taught us a lot more about the process of rasterizing. 
The CPU version will never be usable for bigger projects, but it was very satisfying to see built week by week.  

## Software
Visual studio c++
DirectX11
