# [Cuphead remake](https://github.com/DaanDemaecker/CupheadRemake)
In my Programming 2 class, our skills we learned in the first semester were put to the test.  
We had to choose a 2D platformer game and recreate it as best as possible using a minor framework.  
I chose Cuphead as game because I have always loved the style and wanted a challenge.  
The result speaks for itself
