## intro
For my Graphics Programming 1 class, we made a CPU raytracer from scratch. 
The performance will never be great as it runs purely on CPU, but it helped us understand core concepts of graphics programming and raytracing. 

## Capabilities
- Rendering primitives:  
  The raytracer can render primitives like triangles and spheres, which comprise most of 3D rendering.
