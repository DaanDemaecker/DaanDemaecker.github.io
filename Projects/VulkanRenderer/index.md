# Description
While studying Game Development at Digital Arts and Entertainment in Kortrijk, Belgium, I followed a Graphics Programming class. We made a self-made software rasterizer and a DirectX rasterizer in this class. These were later combined and can be found on my GitHub.
This made me look into more rendering APIs and I landed on Vulkan to make my own Renderer.
This renderer is also integrated into my self-made engine, as my engine project grew, this project became more of a testing ground for Vulkan.

# Software
Visual Studio C++  
CMake  
Vulkan
